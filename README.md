# 2021 Database System
This repository contains projects of 2021 spring Database System class.

## Project Description

> The application is an automobile company, such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen (or maybe a company from yesteryear like Studebaker, Hudson, Nash, or Packard). In our hypothetical company, it has been decided to redesign a major part of the database that underlies company operations. Unfortunately, the manager assigned to solicit database design proposals is not very computer literate and is unable to provide a very detailed specification at the technical level. Fortunately, you are able to do that.The company needs to keep quite a bit of data, but we shall focus on the following aspects of corporate operations

### Project 1
>The goal of this project is to provide a realistic experience in the conceptual design, logical design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a relational database and associated applications.
#### Requirements
* Construct an E-R diagram representing the conceptual design of the database.
* After creating an E-R model, reduce it into Schema diagram.
### Project 2
>The goal of this project is to provide a realistic experience in the physical design, query processing implementation and maintenance of a small relational database you made in Project 1.
#### Requirements
* Decompose your ER model to BCNF
* After creating an logical schema diagram, also create Physical Schema diagram.
